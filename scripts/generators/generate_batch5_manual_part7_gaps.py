"""
generate_batch5_manual_part7_gaps.py — adds the handful of exercises the
Combat Sports & Rugby S&C Manual names in Part 7 (variation library) and
Part 7.7 (injury-friendly substitution table) that weren't already in the
database under any name. Nearly everything in Part 7 already existed
(Hang Power Clean -> "Barbell Hang Power Clean", Landmine Press/Row/Squat,
GHD Back/Hip Extension, Nordic Hamstring Curl, Belt Squat family, Kettlebell
Swing/Clean & Press/Turkish Get-Up, box/broad/lateral/depth jumps, Seal Row,
Pendlay Row, Weighted Pull-Up/Dip, etc. all pre-date this pass) - this file
is deliberately small, covering only the genuine gaps:

  - Band-Assisted Pull-Up / Band-Assisted Dip (Part 7.3's named regression
    step "while building toward strict bodyweight reps" - the database had
    Negative Pull-Up as a regression but no band-assisted option).
  - Landmine Anti-Rotation Press / "half-kneeling" (Part 7.5's core/prehab
    option - the database had Landmine Press, Landmine Rotation, and
    Landmine Row, but not this anti-rotation variant).
  - Neutral-Grip Dumbbell Press (Part 7.7's named shoulder-pain substitute
    for bench/overhead press - the database had "Neutral Grip Pull-Up" but
    no neutral-grip *press*).
  - Fat-Grip Row (Part 7.7's named elbow-pain ["grappler's elbow"]
    substitute for curls/strict pull-ups - reduces direct forearm/elbow
    loading vs. a standard-grip row).

Same authoring discipline as batch2-4: base fields (id, name, category,
movement_pattern, difficulty, experience_level, equipment, equipment_level,
muscles, joint_stress, injuries_to_avoid, strength_requirements,
progressions/regressions/alternatives, sport_priority) are hand-tagged from
real biomechanics; run enrich_exercises.py afterward to derive the v4.0+
movement-analysis/athletic-quality fields the same way every other exercise
in the file gets them, so nothing is hand-faked.

Run: python scripts/generate_batch5_manual_part7_gaps.py

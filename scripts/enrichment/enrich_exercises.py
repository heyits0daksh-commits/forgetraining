"""
enrich_exercises.py — one-time (re-runnable) migration that adds the v4.0
optional metadata fields to every exercise in exercises.json.

Purely additive: every existing key on every exercise is preserved byte-for-
byte. Only new keys are added (movement_plane, movement_type, chain_type,
force_type, velocity_type, stability_requirement, balance_requirement,
coordination_requirement, mobility_requirement, technical_complexity,
learning_curve, skill_requirement, fatigue_cost, CNS_fatigue,
recovery_time_hours, athletic_qualities). Safe to re-run any time new
exercises are added to the file — it will just enrich whatever's new.

"""
add_mma_sport.py — one-time (re-runnable) migration that adds "MMA" as a
sport_priority key to every exercise in exercises.json, plus the "MMA"
quality/movement profiles in backend/services/sport_profiles.py (already
added by hand - this script only touches the data file).

WHY DERIVED, NOT HAND-AUTHORED
Every other sport's sport_priority number was hand-typed per exercise. MMA is
a genuine hybrid of sports the data already scores (striking: Boxing, Muay
Thai; grappling: Wrestling, BJJ, Judo), so instead of hand-typing a 13th
opinion for all ~443 exercises, this derives it as a weighted blend of
whichever of those five an exercise already has a score for - the same
"encode the reasoning once, derive the numbers" principle sport_profiles.py
itself uses for the quality-overlap half of blended_transfer_score.

Exercises with none of the five component sports scored (e.g. a pure
isolation accessory movement) get no MMA key at all, same as they have no
Boxing/Wrestling/etc. key - "not scored for this sport" stays meaningfully
different from "scored zero for this sport".

Safe to re-run: MMA is recomputed from the component sports every time, never
accumulated onto a previous run's value.

"""
conditioning_protocols.py — the sport-agnostic reference material from the
Combat Sports & Rugby Strength & Conditioning Manual that sits *around* the
lifting templates rather than inside them: what aerobic vs. lactic training
actually is (Part 2), the pick-one-of-these session menus for each (Part 6),
the pre-lift warm-up protocol (Part 9.1), and the two add-ons the manual
says apply "regardless of sport or split" (Part 1).

WHY THIS EXISTS
sport_profiles.py already encodes *why* an exercise transfers to a sport.
This module encodes the manual's own conditioning menus verbatim-in-
structure (not verbatim text — summarized/restructured as data) so the
Program Builder can hand back a concrete "pick one of these" aerobic/lactic
session alongside the lifting days, instead of only ever prescribing
barbell work. Kept separate from program_builder.py because none of this
is split-specific — the same menus apply no matter which of the 6 templates
a person is running.

"""
strength_standards.py — turns raw 1RM / rep-max numbers into an *estimated*
overall training level (Beginner..Elite), instead of relying on self-report
alone.

WHY THIS EXISTS
`experience_level` (schemas.py) has always been a field the *person* picks
from a dropdown - nothing anywhere in the engine ever checked whether that
pick matched what their own numbers say. Self-assessed training level is
notoriously unreliable (most lifters over- or under-rate themselves), and
`experience_level` isn't cosmetic here - it's a hard ceiling on exercise
difficulty (main.py's `level_ok` check), on which split templates are even
offered (program_builder.py's `EXPERIENCE_SPLIT_ALLOWLIST`), and on which
periodization model gets used (linear vs. daily-undulating). A mis-stated
level quietly flows through all three - e.g. someone who's actually a
beginner but self-rates "Advanced" gets routed straight into a Bro Split or
PHAT, the exact "specialization before the technique/work-capacity base is
there" mismatch `program_builder.py` already warns about in its own
comments.

This module doesn't override the person's stated `experience_level` - it
computes a second, independent estimate from their actual lift numbers
(relative to bodyweight) and bodyweight-exercise rep maxes, so the frontend
can suggest/pre-fill a level and show its work, while the person keeps
final say. See `backend/main.py`'s `POST /api/v1/estimate-level` and
`evaluate_biometrics_and_strength`.

THE STANDARDS THEMSELVES
Bodyweight-ratio thresholds below are *approximate*, commonly-cited
benchmarks in the strength-training community (the same rough shape you'll
see published across sources like Lon Kilgore's standards tables,
StrengthLevel.com's aggregated lifter data, and ExRx.net's strength
standards) - not a clinical or federation-verified scale, and different
sources disagree by 10-20% at the margins. Treat this as a reasonable,
transparent default a person can always override by hand, not a verdict.

Men's and women's tables are kept separate rather than one table scaled by
a flat percentage: the sex gap in relative (bodyweight-adjusted) strength is
well-documented as uneven across movements - largest in upper-body pressing,
smaller in hip-dominant lifts like the squat and deadlift - so a single
scaled table would misrepresent that shape. Sex is optional; omitting it
falls back to a blended men's/women's table, flagged as lower-confidence.

    be, just enough to stop "no numbers entered" from silently collapsing

"""
knowledge_graph.py — the actual multi-relational graph FORGE reasons over.

WHY THIS EXISTS
`main.py`'s `base_dag` is a real graph, but it only ever encodes ONE
relationship: "completing exercise A unlocks exercise B" (progressions). Every
other relationship an exercise has - which joints it loads, which injuries it's
a safe rehab pick for, which sports it transfers to and why, which exercises
substitute for it when equipment is missing - was either a flat unconnected
field on the node (`sport_priority`, `joint_stress`) or logic buried inside a
single request-handling function (`generate_session`) that nothing else could
query.

This module builds one graph with those relationships as first-class,
labeled, directed edges between typed nodes (exercise / joint / injury /
sport), so:
  - the relationships are inspectable on their own (see main.py's new
    /api/v1/knowledge-graph/{exercise_id} endpoint) instead of only visible
    as a side effect of running a full prescription request, and
  - new reasoning can be added by adding a new edge type here, instead of by
    threading more ad-hoc logic through generate_session.

EDGE TYPES
    progresses_to      exercise -> exercise   (existing progressions field)
    substitute_for      exercise <-> exercise  (declared alternatives, plus a
                        derived fallback: same movement_pattern + same/lower
                        difficulty + different equipment)
    stresses_joint      exercise -> joint      (from joint_stress)
    rehab_candidate_for exercise -> injury     (derived: low load, and the
                        exercise's own athletic_qualities show it actively
                        trains stability of the injury's joint)
    transfers_to_sport  exercise -> sport      (from sport_profiles, one edge
                        per sport with weight + rationale)

Sport-transfer and rehab-candidacy also depend on values a single request can
override (difficulty via custom_progressions), so the same scoring functions
used to build these edges are also exposed standalone for main.py to call
against live, possibly-overridden node data - the graph is the map of the
default/base relationships, not the only place the logic lives.
